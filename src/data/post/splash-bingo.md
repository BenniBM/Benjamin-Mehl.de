## What is Splash Bingo?

Splash Bingo is a game where players compete against each other to see who can perform the most predetermined dives. Each dive is defined by 4 parameters (height, twists, somersaults, special). By revealing the fields, the parameter (e.g. height) is defined. To get more points, players reveal more of these fields. However, this makes the dive more challenging. Points are only awarded when the dive is successfully completed.
