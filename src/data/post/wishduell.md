## What was the project's goal?

The project aimed to give us experience working in a large team (6 people). This included applying more complex Git workflows and learning how to structure a project from the ground up. Additionally, the project was meant to be a real application that could be used by other people.

## Which technologies were used?

| Technology  | Usage                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Traefik     | Reverse Proxy          |
| Sveltekit   | Frontend Framework     |
| Spring Boot | Backend Framework      |
| Socket.io   | Realtime Communication |
| PostgreSQL  | Database               |
| Docker      | Containerization       |

## What were my responsibilities?

- REST Backend with Spring Boot
- Creating and handling Socket Events with Socket.io
- Docker Compose for containerization
- Creating CI/CD pipelines with Gitlab Runners

## What I learned

Through collaboration in a relatively large team, I learned the importance of having a structured workflow, such as creating issues. Learning Docker and Docker Compose was also very helpful in making the initialization of the development environment easy for every team member. Additionally, I got to learn many new technologies, such as websockets and reverse proxies.
